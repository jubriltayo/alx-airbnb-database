# Advanced SQL Querying and Optimization in Airbnb Database

## Overview

This project delves into advanced SQL querying, optimization, and database performance techniques using a simulated Airbnb database. It covers critical database management concepts such as joins, subqueries, aggregations, indexing, and partitioning. The goal is to help learners master complex SQL tasks, optimize query performance, and understand how to scale databases efficiently for large-scale applications.

Through practical exercises, learners will gain hands-on experience with real-world challenges in data retrieval and performance tuning, preparing them to handle the performance demands of high-traffic applications.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will have mastered:

- **Advanced SQL**: Writing complex queries using joins, subqueries, and aggregations.
- **Query Optimization**: Using performance monitoring tools like EXPLAIN and ANALYZE to improve query efficiency.
- **Indexing and Partitioning**: Implementing indexing and table partitioning to enhance performance for large datasets.
- **Database Performance Monitoring**: Continuously refining your database schema and queries based on performance insights.
- **Strategic Database Design**: Thinking like a DBA to design optimized schemas and implement efficient queries for high-volume applications.

## Key Skills Acquired

1. **Complex Joins**: Expertise in combining data from multiple tables using INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN.
2. **Subqueries**: Writing both correlated and non-correlated subqueries to perform advanced data analysis.
3. **Aggregations & Window Functions**: Applying aggregation functions (COUNT, SUM) and window functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK) to analyze datasets effectively.
4. **Indexing for Performance**: Identifying performance bottlenecks and creating indexes to improve query execution times.
5. **Partitioning Large Tables**: Implementing table partitioning to optimize queries on large datasets, particularly those filtered by date ranges.
6. **Performance Monitoring**: Using tools like SHOW PROFILE and EXPLAIN ANALYZE to track query performance and suggest improvements.

## Project Workflow

### 1. **Defining Relationships with ER Diagrams**

Understanding and designing **Entity-Relationship (ER)** diagrams to model relationships between tables such as **Users**, **Bookings**, **Properties**, and **Reviews** in the Airbnb schema.

### 2. **Complex Queries with Joins**

Writing queries that involve multiple tables using different types of joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN) to extract meaningful insights from the database.

### 3. **Power of Subqueries**

Writing **correlated** and **non-correlated subqueries** to solve complex data retrieval challenges. These subqueries allow for deep data analysis, such as filtering properties by average rating or finding users based on activity thresholds.

### 4. **Aggregations and Window Functions**

Applying **aggregation functions** like COUNT, SUM, and advanced **window functions** such as ROW_NUMBER and RANK. These functions are used to rank and analyze data, unlocking powerful capabilities for large-scale data analysis.

### 5. **Indexing for Optimization**

Learning how to identify bottlenecks in queries and creating **indexes** for frequently queried columns. Indexing improves query performance significantly, especially on large datasets.

### 6. **Query Optimization Techniques**

Refactoring inefficient queries by analyzing their execution plans with **EXPLAIN** and **ANALYZE**. Learners then reduce redundancy and improve performance by applying indexing and optimizing SQL scripts.

### 7. **Partitioning Large Tables**

Implementing **table partitioning** to optimize the performance of queries filtering large datasets by dates. This is particularly useful in the **Booking** table where queries frequently filter by date ranges.

### 8. **Performance Monitoring and Refinement**

Using **EXPLAIN ANALYZE** and **SHOW PROFILE** to monitor and optimize the performance of queries. This includes identifying bottlenecks, creating indexes, and refining the schema to improve database efficiency.
